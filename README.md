Calndr
======

Simple Pure-Pascal app to read an ics file and do some basic date and
calendar functions.

The initial goal is to show a list of events from the .ics file.

Usage:

./calndr.ttp  <filename.ics>  /<directory>/

e.g.

 ./calndr.ttp  meet.ics  /f/

will show details of the events in the ics file and then the
calendar for the current month.
