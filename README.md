Calndr
======

Simple Pure-Pascal app to read an ics file and do some basic date and
calendar functions.

The initial goal is to show a list of simple events from .ics files.

Usage:

./calndr.ttp  \<directory\>

e.g.

 ./calndr.ttp  /f/

will load all the *.ics files from the folder and show details of the events
that fall between a (hard-coded) start and end day range.
